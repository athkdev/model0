#### The tech stack:

We use Vuejs along with the Nuxt framework on the frontend.

We use the mighty Python framework Django on the backend, and PostgreSQL as a database.


We heavily rely on AWS apps such as AWS EC2 for deployment, AWS RDS for Postgres, and AWS SageMaker for all the ML-Ops heavy lifting.

#### Why this problem statement?

This platform is mainly targeted toward developers who do not want to go too deep in AWS services, but be able to still deploy and integrate chat-bots into their own apps.


I noticed that there are already a lot of new-age applications which make versatile (and honestly very creative) integrations with chat bots, and they usually get loved by customers.


One such app is Jobright - they are a job hunting tool. But they have a chat bot that people can communicate to regarding very context specific things.  For example, if a user is currently viewing a job application, the user can ask the chat bot things like **_"Is my resume a good match for this role?"_** OR **_"Can you direct me to 3 people who currently are at this company that I can connect with on LinkedIn?"_**
